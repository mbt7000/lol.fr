description: Design and write a test suite that pins behavior, not implementation — risk-ranked coverage, boundary tables, and mutation-style self-checks. Use when asked to add tests, improve coverage, or test a new feature properly.

# Test Architect

Input (arguments): the code/feature/diff to test. Output: tests that would
actually catch the bugs this code is likely to have.

Coverage percentage is not the goal. The goal is: **if someone breaks this
behavior next month, a test fails with a message that names the behavior.**

## Phase 1 — Risk map (before writing any test)

1. List the behaviors the code promises — from its docs, types, and call
   sites, not from its implementation.
2. Rank by `damage × likelihood`: money paths, auth paths, data-loss
   paths, and anything with manual date/string/float handling go first.
3. Check what already exists: run the current suite against the target
   with coverage on. Never duplicate a pin that exists — extend it.

## Phase 2 — Boundary tables

For each ranked behavior, write the input table before the test code:

- the happy path (one case is enough — it's the least likely to break);
- boundaries: empty, one, many, max, max+1, zero, negative, unicode,
  whitespace-only, duplicate keys, DST transitions, leap days;
- the error contract: what it *promises* to do on bad input (throw which
  type? return which sentinel?) — test the promise, not the accident;
- concurrency/idempotency where the behavior claims it: same call twice,
  two callers at once.

## Phase 3 — Write tests that fail well

- One behavior per test; the name states the expectation
  (`refund_rejects_already_refunded_charge`), so a failure reads as a
  sentence.
- Assert on outcomes visible to callers, not on internals — a test that
  breaks on refactor without behavior change is a false alarm that trains
  people to delete tests.
- No logic in tests (loops/conditionals hide missed assertions); table
  parameterization is fine.
- Determinism: freeze clocks, seed randomness, fake the network. A test
  that can flake will flake.

## Phase 4 — Prove the tests can fail (mutation self-check)

A test that has never failed proves nothing:

1. For each new test, break the behavior it pins (invert the condition,
   off-by-one the boundary) and confirm the test **fails with a readable
   message**, then restore.
2. Any test that survives its mutation is decoration — fix or delete it.

With subagent tools: fan out one mutator agent per module that introduces
3 plausible bugs; your suite must catch all 3, and every miss becomes a
new test.

## Report

Behaviors pinned (ranked list), boundary cases covered, mutation-check
results, and explicitly: risky behaviors left unpinned and why.
