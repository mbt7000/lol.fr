name: plan-builder
description: Turn a multi-week goal or stalled project into an executable plan by backcasting from the outcome — milestones with kill-criteria, risk-first ordering, and a first slice startable today, wired into the work hub. Use when the user has a goal spanning weeks with no path, or a stalled project. For specifying a single buildable feature, use spec-first instead.

# Plan Builder

Input (arguments): a goal — from the user or from `growth-map`'s
stalled list. Output: a plan the person can *start today*, written into
the project's page in `work/projects/`, with its first slice already in
the hub's Next up.

**Scope boundary**: this skill plans *journeys* (weeks-to-months:
learning paths, product launches, migrations-of-life); `spec-first`
specifies *deliverables* (one buildable feature). A journey's milestone
often begins by handing a deliverable to `spec-first`.

A plan's job is not to predict the future; it's to make the next action
obvious and the failure modes visible early.

## Phase 1 — Define done, then backcast

1. Write the end state as observably true/false: "the API serves 100
   req/s in production", "I can fix a real bug in a Rust codebase
   unaided" — never "make progress on X".
2. **Backcast**: from the end state, ask "what must be true immediately
   before this?" repeatedly until today. Forward plans follow what's
   easy to start; backcast plans follow what the outcome requires.
3. The chain becomes 3–7 **milestones**, each observable — never
   activities ("work on auth" is not a milestone).

## Phase 2 — Order by risk

Reorder so the **riskiest assumption is tested earliest** — the thing
that, if false, kills the plan. Most plans die at 80% because the scary
part was saved for last. Each milestone carries:

- the assumption it tests,
- a **kill-criterion**: the result that means "stop or redesign",
  agreed now while heads are cool.

## Phase 3 — Write it into the hub's format

The plan lives in the project's page using `work-hub`'s page contract
(goal / current state / next actions / dated log), **plus a `## Plan`
section** holding the milestone table (milestone, assumption,
kill-criterion, status) and the capacity math. If no hub exists,
bootstrap a minimal one first (`work-hub`).

Slice **milestone 1 only** into hub-sized items; the *last checkbox of
every milestone is written explicitly as* `run the milestone review
(assumption? kill-criterion? estimate error?) and slice the next
milestone` — that line is what makes re-planning happen without anyone
remembering to. Do not slice milestones 2+; far-future slicing is
fiction. The first slice goes into `HUB.md` Next up before this skill
ends.

## Phase 4 — Reality checks

- The milestone-review checkbox (Phase 3) is the trigger: when it's
  reached, review assumption/kill-criterion/estimate, log the result on
  the project page, slice the next milestone.
- Capacity honesty: the plan states its weekly budget and the calendar
  math ("~6 weeks at 3 sessions/week"). A plan that ignores capacity
  is a wish.
- Wide solution space (which architecture, which learning path)? Run a
  `judge-panel` on the approach *before* backcasting.

## Rules

- Every plan has a kill-criterion somewhere; a plan that can't fail
  can't inform.
- Re-plan on evidence (tripped criterion, milestone review), not on
  mood.
- The user decides pivots — surface the tripped criterion with options
  and a recommendation.
