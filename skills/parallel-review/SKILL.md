description: Review the current diff (or a named PR/range) by fanning out one reviewer per dimension — correctness, security, performance, tests, simplification — then adversarially verifying findings before reporting. Use when asked to review code thoroughly.

# Parallel Review

Input (arguments): optional — a PR number, commit range, or paths. Default:
the working diff (`git diff` + staged), else the branch's diff against the
default branch.

## Phase 0 — Scope (inline)

Collect the diff and the list of changed files. If the diff is trivial
(< ~30 lines), skip the fan-out and review it inline with the same
dimensions as a checklist.

## Phase 1 — Dimension fan-out (parallel, blind)

Spawn one reviewer per dimension in a single batch. Every reviewer gets the
full diff, paths to changed files (they can read surrounding code), and
returns findings as `{file, line, severity, summary, failure_scenario}` —
a finding without a concrete failure scenario is not a finding.

- **Correctness**: logic errors, off-by-ones, broken invariants, races,
  error paths that swallow or corrupt. The only reviewer allowed to be
  paranoid about "what if this input…".
- **Security**: injection, authz gaps, secrets, unsafe deserialization,
  path traversal, SSRF — *in the changed code and what it newly exposes*.
- **Performance**: new N+1s, quadratic loops on unbounded input, sync I/O
  on hot paths, missing indexes, cache-defeating patterns.
- **Tests**: does the diff change behavior that no test pins? Name the
  missing test cases concretely, not "add more tests".
- **Simplification**: duplicated logic that existing helpers already
  provide, dead branches, needless abstraction — cleanups only, no bugs.

## Phase 2 — Deduplicate (inline)

Merge findings; collapse duplicates across dimensions (a bug is often also
a missing test). Keep the highest-severity framing.

## Phase 3 — Verify (parallel)

For every finding of severity medium or higher, spawn one verifier prompted
to **refute** it: read the actual code (not just the diff), check whether
the failure scenario can really occur, run the relevant test if cheap.
Verdict `CONFIRMED` or `FALSE_POSITIVE` with one line of evidence. Drop
false positives — a review that cries wolf gets ignored.

## Phase 4 — Report (inline)

Ranked by severity: file:line, one-sentence defect, the failure scenario,
suggested fix direction. Then a short cleanups section (unverified,
labeled as such). End with what was *not* reviewed (generated files,
vendored code, dimensions skipped).

## Rules

- Reviewers are blind to each other; the same bug found twice is signal,
  not waste.
- Never report an unverified medium+ finding without labeling it.
- If asked to also fix: fix only `CONFIRMED` findings, one commit per
  logical fix.

## Fallback (no subagent tools)

Run the five dimensions as separate labeled passes over the diff — finish
each pass before starting the next — then a final refutation pass on your
own medium+ findings before reporting.
