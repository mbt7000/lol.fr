name: sci-research
description: Scientific research workflow (physics, chemistry, biology, CS theory) — formalize the hypothesis, run a parallel literature sweep including replication and null results, critique methodology, and produce a research memo. Use for scientific questions, literature reviews, or evaluating a proposed hypothesis/experiment.

# Scientific Research

Treat the question passed as arguments as a scientific inquiry, not a
lookup. The output is a **research memo**: hypothesis, state of the
evidence, methodological critique, and open problems.

## Phase 0 — Formalize (inline)

1. Restate the question as one or more **falsifiable hypotheses**. If the
   user gave a vague topic ("quantum batteries?"), write the 2–3 hypotheses
   the field actually argues about.
2. Note the quantities involved and their units/scales — many wrong papers
   die on a dimensional-analysis or order-of-magnitude check.
3. Write the ideal experiment that would settle each hypothesis, even if
   impractical. It anchors the evidence quality scale.

## Phase 1 — Literature sweep (parallel, blind)

Spawn one agent per lane, in a single batch:

- **Foundational lane** — the canonical papers/reviews establishing the
  effect or theory; extract the actual measured values and error bars.
- **Frontier lane** — preprints and papers from the last ~24 months
  (arXiv, journals); what changed recently.
- **Skeptic lane** — replication failures, retractions, comment/reply
  exchanges, null results. This lane exists because positive results are
  overrepresented; its findings outrank the others' in a conflict.
- **Methods lane** — how the key measurements are actually made; dominant
  systematic errors; what apparatus/simulation scale is required.
- **Cross-field lane** — adjacent fields attacking the same problem with
  different tools.

Each agent returns `{finding, paper/source, year, evidence type
(experiment / simulation / theory / review), key numbers}` — raw data, no
narrative.

## Phase 2 — Evidence table (inline)

Build one table per hypothesis: supporting vs. contradicting results, each
tagged with evidence type and year. Apply hard filters:

- a single unreplicated experiment is a *lead*, not a fact;
- simulation-only support is labeled as such;
- check the numbers for unit and order-of-magnitude consistency yourself.

## Phase 3 — Methodological critique (parallel)

For the 3–5 results the conclusion will rest on, spawn one critic each,
prompted as a hostile referee: sample size / statistics, systematic errors,
whether the claimed effect exceeds the error bars, whether alternative
explanations were excluded. Verdict: `solid` / `suggestive` / `weak`, one
sentence why.

## Phase 4 — Research memo (inline)

1. **State of the hypothesis** — supported / contested / refuted / open,
   with the strength of that verdict.
2. **The evidence** — the table from Phase 2, with critique verdicts.
3. **Where the field disagrees** and what measurement would resolve it.
4. **Open problems / next experiments** — concrete and prioritized.
5. Full citations. Never cite a paper you did not actually see; mark
   secondhand citations explicitly.

## Rules

- Never present consensus and frontier speculation in the same register.
- Numbers travel with units and uncertainties, or they don't travel.
- Two sweep rounds maximum; then write the memo with the gaps stated.

## Fallback (no subagent tools)

Run the five lanes as sequential searches, keeping separate notes per lane;
run the referee critique as a distinct pass before writing the memo.
