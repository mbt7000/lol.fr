name: judge-panel
description: Solve a wide-solution-space problem by generating N independent solutions from different angles, scoring them with independent judges, and synthesizing the winner plus the runners-up's best ideas. Use for design decisions, architecture choices, naming, algorithms, or any "what's the best way to…" question.

# Judge Panel

Input (arguments): a problem with more than one plausible solution.
Output: one recommended solution with scored alternatives.

This beats "one attempt, then iterate" when the solution space is wide:
iteration climbs the hill you started on; a panel starts on several hills.

## Phase 1 — Independent generation (parallel, blind)

Spawn 3–5 solver agents in one batch. Each gets the same problem statement
and constraints, but a **forced angle** so they don't converge:

- **Simplest-thing angle**: minimal solution, boring technology, least code.
- **Risk-first angle**: optimize for failure modes; what won't wake anyone
  at 3am.
- **User-first angle**: optimize the experience/API surface; internals bend
  to fit.
- **Performance angle**: optimize the hot path; measure, don't guess.
- **Future-proof angle**: optimize for the change that's coming next.

Each solver returns: the solution (concrete — sketch the API/schema/steps),
its three biggest weaknesses (self-declared), and what it deliberately
sacrificed.

## Phase 2 — Judging (parallel)

Spawn 2–3 judge agents in one batch. Each judge receives **all** solutions
with the angle labels stripped, and a scoring rubric you write from the
user's actual constraints (weight what they said matters). Judges score
each solution 1–10 per rubric dimension with one sentence of justification,
and must name the strongest single idea in each losing solution.

Judges never see each other's scores.

## Phase 3 — Synthesis (inline — never delegate)

1. Aggregate scores; identify the winner and any dimension where a loser
   decisively beat it.
2. **Graft**: pull the judges' "strongest ideas" from losers into the
   winner where they fit without contradiction.
3. Present: recommendation, the score table, why the runners-up lost, and
   what was grafted in from them. If two solutions tied, present both with
   the single question whose answer would break the tie.

## Rules

- Never let solvers see each other's work — the diversity *is* the value.
- The rubric comes from the user's constraints, not a generic checklist.
- One round. A second generation round is justified only if all solutions
  failed the same constraint — then re-run with that constraint hardened.

## Fallback (no subagent tools)

Write the 3 solutions yourself in fully separated sections, committing to
each angle honestly before starting the next. Then judge in a fresh pass
against the rubric. The discipline of not blending during generation is
what preserves the panel effect.
