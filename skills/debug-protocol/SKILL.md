# Debug Protocol

Input (arguments): a bug report, error message, failing test, or symptom.
Output: root cause with evidence, and (if asked) a proven fix.

The discipline that separates expert debugging from guessing: **never
change code before you can reproduce the failure, and never claim a fix
before the reproduction passes.**

## Phase 1 — Reproduce (nothing else until this is done)

1. Turn the report into a minimal, deterministic reproduction: exact
   command, input, environment. Automate it (a script or failing test).
2. If it won't reproduce: gather the delta between the reporting
   environment and yours (versions, config, data, timing) — the delta *is*
   the lead. For flaky failures, loop the reproduction (100x) to measure
   the failure rate; a rate is a measurement you can compare against later.
3. Record the exact failure signature: message, stack, wrong value. You
   will diff against this later — "some error" and "the same error" are
   different facts.

## Phase 2 — Hypothesize (before reading much code)

Write 3–5 candidate causes ranked by prior probability, each with the
observation that would confirm or kill it. Cheap-to-test outranks
plausible: check the config typo before the race condition.

Classic priors worth ranking: recent changes (`git log` on the involved
paths), environment/version skew, boundary inputs (empty, unicode, DST,
timezone, 32/64-bit), shared mutable state, error paths that swallow.

## Phase 3 — Bisect the space (one variable at a time)

- Test hypotheses in rank order. Each experiment changes **one** variable
  and has a predicted outcome written *before* running it. An experiment
  whose result you can't predict either way is a fishing trip — redesign it.
- Use binary search aggressively: `git bisect` over history, deleting half
  the input, stubbing half the pipeline. Halving beats reading.
- Log each experiment in one line: variable changed → predicted → observed.
  When observed ≠ predicted, that's information — update the ranking, don't
  push on.

## Phase 4 — Root cause, then fix

1. State the root cause as a causal chain: "X leads to Y leads to the
   observed Z" — and verify each link, not just the ends.
2. Fix the cause, not the symptom. If the honest fix is out of scope, say
   so and mark the symptom patch as such.
3. **Prove it**: the Phase 1 reproduction now passes; the rest of the
   suite still passes; for flaky bugs, the failure rate measured in
   Phase 1 is now 0 over the same loop count.
4. Sweep for siblings: the same pattern elsewhere in the codebase
   (grep for it) — bugs come in families.

## Stop conditions

- Three consecutive experiments with observed = predicted-null → your
  hypothesis set is exhausted; go back to Phase 2 with the new facts,
  don't keep poking.
- If reproduction is impossible after honest effort, report exactly what
  was tried and what environmental data would unblock — that report is a
  legitimate deliverable.

## Parallel variant

With subagent tools available: run Phase 2's top 3 hypotheses as parallel
investigators (each gets the reproduction + one hypothesis), and use
`adversarial-verify` on the final root-cause claim before reporting.
