description: Defensive security review of a codebase or diff — threat-model first, then trace untrusted data paths, authz on every mutation, secrets hygiene, and dependency exposure; every finding proven with a concrete attack path. Use for security reviews, hardening passes, or pre-release checks.

# Security Audit

Input (arguments): a repo, module, or diff to audit (defensive review of
code you own/are authorized to assess). Output: findings ranked by
exploitability, each with a concrete attack path — no vague "consider
sanitizing".

A finding without an attack path is a style comment. The bar for every
item reported: *who* (which principal), sends *what* (concrete input),
reaching *where* (endpoint/function), causing *what* (impact).

## Phase 1 — Threat model (15 minutes, on paper)

1. Enumerate entry points where untrusted data enters: HTTP handlers,
   queue consumers, file uploads, webhooks, CLI args, env/config parsed
   from user-controlled sources, LLM tool outputs.
2. Enumerate the assets: credentials, PII, money mutations, admin
   surfaces.
3. Enumerate trust boundaries crossed between them. The audit is the
   walk from every entry point toward every asset.

## Phase 2 — Trace the paths (the core work)

For each entry point, follow the data:

- **Injection family**: does the data reach a SQL/shell/eval/template/
  path/deserializer sink without parameterization? Trace the actual code
  path — don't grep-and-guess.
- **Authz on every mutation**: for each state-changing endpoint, where is
  the check that *this* principal may touch *this* object (IDOR)? "Logged
  in" is authn, not authz.
- **SSRF / redirect**: any user-influenced URL that the server fetches or
  redirects to.
- **Secrets**: hardcoded keys, secrets in logs/error messages, tokens in
  URLs, `.env` files in the repo or image layers.
- **Crypto & sessions**: home-rolled crypto, non-constant-time compares,
  predictable tokens, missing expiry/rotation, cookies without
  HttpOnly/Secure/SameSite.
- **Dependencies**: known-vulnerable versions (run the ecosystem's audit
  tool), install scripts, typosquat-adjacent names.
- **DoS-shaped bugs**: unbounded request bodies, zip/JSON bombs,
  quadratic parsing on user input, missing rate limits on auth endpoints.

## Phase 3 — Prove, don't presume

For each candidate finding, verify exploitability in a **safe, local**
way: a failing test case or a local curl against a dev instance
demonstrating the behavior. Findings that can't be demonstrated get
downgraded to "hardening suggestion" and labeled so. Never test against
systems you don't own or lack authorization for.

## Phase 4 — Report

Ranked by exploitability × impact:

- finding, file:line, the concrete attack path, the demonstration,
  and the specific fix (parameterize here, check ownership there);
- a hardening section for the undemonstrated items;
- explicit scope statement: what was NOT audited (infra, other repos,
  runtime config) — silence reads as "checked and clean".

## Parallel variant

With subagent tools: one agent per Phase 2 family, blind, then
`adversarial-verify` on medium+ findings — false positives destroy the
report's credibility with exactly the audience that must act on it.
