name: autopilot
description: Continuous safe work loop over the backlog — pick the next ready task from the hub, route it through conductor, verify, commit, update the hub, repeat until a stop condition. Use when the user says "keep working", "work through the backlog", or sets up a recurring /loop or scheduled routine.

# Autopilot

Input (arguments): optional bounds — max items, time/token budget, or a
scope filter ("only test tasks"). Output: a stream of completed,
verified, committed work items, each logged — and a clean stop with a
handoff report. This is the loop system that makes the library run
*unattended* without becoming dangerous.

## The iteration (repeat until a stop condition fires)

1. **Pick** — take the top item from `HUB.md`'s *Next up* (see
   `work-hub`; if no hub exists, build it first from TODOs, failing
   tests, and open issues — that construction is iteration #1). Take
   only items that are: concretely actioned (a next step exists),
   in scope, and **autonomy-safe** (see below). Skip-and-mark anything
   that isn't, with the reason.
2. **Execute** — route through `conductor` (which right-sizes the
   procedure). One item at a time; no starting item N+1 while N is
   half-done.
3. **Verify** — the item's done-condition holds: tests pass, the
   reproduction is fixed, the doc's commands run. Unverifiable items
   don't get marked done; they get marked "needs human verification"
   with what to check.
4. **Commit** — one item = at least one clean commit (see `git-flow`).
   Push only if standing instructions say so.
5. **Log** — one line to the hub's project page (`done: X — evidence`),
   move the item, refresh `HUB.md`. The hub is the loop's memory; if
   the session dies, the next one resumes from it losslessly.

## Autonomy safety envelope (the part that makes this trustworthy)

Autopilot executes only **reversible, inward-facing** work: edits,
tests, local builds, commits on the working branch, hub/vault updates.

It never, without an explicit standing instruction: force-pushes,
deletes branches or data, changes CI/CD or infra config, publishes
(PRs, releases, comments, deploys), touches secrets, or expands its own
scope ("while I'm here…" is how autopilots crash). Items requiring any
of these get **parked** in a `Blocked — needs human` list with a
prepared recommendation, and the loop moves on. Parked ≠ forgotten:
they lead the final report.

## Stop conditions (all hard, checked every iteration)

- Bounds given in the arguments reached (items / time / budget).
- *Next up* is empty, or only parked items remain.
- **Two consecutive failures** of the same item → park it with the
  failure evidence; a third attempt without new information is thrash.
- Anything smells wrong globally (suite suddenly red on untouched code,
  repo state unexpected) → stop and report rather than "fix" the world.

## Running it on a schedule

- Under `/loop` or a cron/routine: each firing = one bounded run (e.g.
  3 items), ending with the report. Prefer bounded runs over one
  infinite session — bounded runs produce reviewable deltas.
- Between runs, humans add/reorder *Next up*; that file is the steering
  wheel. Autopilot never reorders priorities on its own — it takes the
  queue as given.

## The handoff report (every run ends with one)

Items completed (with commit refs and evidence), items parked (with
recommendations), hub state delta, and — feeding the flywheel — any
recurring friction worth a `skill-forge` candidate. Ten lines maximum;
the diff and the hub carry the detail.
