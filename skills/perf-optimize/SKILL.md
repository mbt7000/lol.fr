# Performance Optimize

Input (arguments): the slow thing and, ideally, how slow is too slow.
Output: measured improvement with reproducible before/after numbers — or
the honest finding that the bottleneck is elsewhere.

The iron rule: **no optimization without a profile, no claim without a
before/after measurement.** Intuition about bottlenecks is wrong often
enough that acting on it unmeasured is negligence.

## Phase 1 — Define the budget and the workload

1. Get a target: p95 latency, RSS, throughput, cost. If the user has none,
   propose one and state it — "faster" is not a finish line.
2. Build a **representative, repeatable workload**: realistic data sizes
   and distributions, warmed caches (or deliberately cold — pick and say
   which), fixed hardware conditions. An unrealistic benchmark optimizes
   the wrong code.
3. Measure baseline: at least 5 runs; report median and spread, not the
   best run. If the spread swamps the differences you'll chase, fix
   measurement noise first.

## Phase 2 — Profile, don't browse

- Use the right instrument: CPU sampling profiler for compute, allocation
  profiler for memory/GC, query logs + EXPLAIN for databases, flame graphs
  for "where does the time go", tracing for cross-service latency.
- Identify the top items by *inclusive share of the budget*. Anything
  under ~5% of total time is not worth touching yet, no matter how ugly.
- Distinguish the four classic shapes before choosing a fix: doing
  unnecessary work (N+1, recompute, over-fetch), doing work in a slow way
  (algorithmic complexity, sync I/O), doing work too often (missing cache,
  chatty loop), and waiting (locks, pool exhaustion) — the profile shape
  tells you which.

## Phase 3 — Fix one thing, re-measure, repeat

Per iteration:

1. One change targeting the current top of the profile, with a predicted
   improvement written down first.
2. Re-run the same workload; compare against prediction. Keep the change
   only if the measured win is real and the tests still pass.
3. Re-profile — the bottleneck moves after every real fix; yesterday's #2
   is not necessarily today's #1.

Prefer, in order: stop doing the work → do it less often → do it faster →
do it on more hardware. Caching goes *after* the first two — a cache in
front of unnecessary work just hides it, and brings invalidation bugs.

## Phase 4 — Report and protect

- Report: baseline → final numbers (same workload, median ± spread), the
  changes that mattered with their individual contribution, and what was
  deliberately not done.
- Protect the win: add the benchmark to the repo with the target as a
  threshold, so the regression is caught by CI, not by users.

## Stop conditions

- Budget met → stop; further optimization is spending complexity for
  nothing.
- Two iterations with < 5% improvement → the remaining cost is structural
  (architecture, physics of the data volume); report that with the
  evidence instead of micro-optimizing.
