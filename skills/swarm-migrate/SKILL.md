description: Large-scale mechanical change across a codebase (API migration, rename, pattern replacement, dependency upgrade) — discover every site exhaustively, transform sites in parallel isolated workers, verify each, and land as reviewable commits. Use for "migrate all X to Y" or "replace every use of Z".

# Swarm Migrate

Input (arguments): the transformation — "migrate all `moment` calls to
`date-fns`", "rename `getUser` to `fetchUser` everywhere", "move all
handlers to the new error type".

Scale is the enemy of two things: **coverage** (missing sites) and
**consistency** (transforming the same pattern two ways). The structure
below attacks both.

## Phase 1 — Discover (exhaustive)

1. Find candidate sites with multiple search strategies, not one grep:
   the symbol itself, its import paths, its string aliases, its dynamic
   uses (reflection, config keys), and test fixtures. If the codebase is
   large, use the `loop-until-dry` pattern here.
2. Produce the **site list**: `{file, line, pattern-variant}`. Classify
   variants — sites that match the pattern differently will need different
   transforms.
3. **Write the transform spec inline**: for each variant, an exact
   before/after example. This spec is the single source of consistency;
   every worker gets it verbatim. If a variant has no clear transform,
   resolve it now (or ask the user) — never let workers improvise policy.

## Phase 2 — Transform (parallel, isolated)

- Batch the site list by file (never split one file across workers).
- Spawn workers in parallel; **each worker must run in an isolated
  worktree** if the tooling supports it (`isolation: worktree`), because
  parallel workers mutating one checkout corrupt each other. If isolation
  is unavailable, fall back to sequential batches.
- Worker prompt: the transform spec, its file batch, and the rules —
  transform only listed sites; if a site doesn't match any variant,
  **skip it and report it back** rather than guessing; preserve
  surrounding style; don't reformat untouched lines.

## Phase 3 — Verify (per batch, parallel)

For each completed batch: build/typecheck the touched files, run the tests
covering them, and re-grep the batch's files for the *old* pattern —
zero remaining matches or the leftover is explained. A batch that fails
verification gets one retry with the failure in the prompt, then falls to
you to fix inline.

## Phase 4 — Land (inline)

1. Merge worker results; re-run the Phase 1 discovery **once more** over
   the final tree — transforms sometimes create new matches or reveal
   missed ones.
2. Run the full test suite once on the merged result.
3. Commit in reviewable units (by subsystem or by variant), with the
   skipped/unclear sites listed in the final report, not buried.

## Rules

- The transform spec is written once, inline, before any worker runs.
- Workers never decide policy; they apply spec or skip-and-report.
- Report format: sites found / transformed / skipped (with reasons) /
  remaining old-pattern matches (should be 0 or explained).

## Fallback (no subagent tools)

Same phases, sequential: the spec still gets written first, files still
process in batches with per-batch verification, and the final re-discovery
sweep is still mandatory.
