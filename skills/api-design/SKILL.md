description: Design an API contract-first — resources and invariants before endpoints, explicit error contract, pagination/idempotency/versioning decided up front, validated against real call sequences. Use when designing or reviewing HTTP/RPC/library APIs.

# API Design

Input (arguments): the capability the API must expose, and its consumers.
Output: a written contract (spec + example calls) that survived a
walkthrough of real usage — *before* any implementation.

An API is a promise you can't easily unmake. Every decision below is cheap
now and a breaking change later.

## Phase 1 — Model before endpoints

1. List the **nouns** (resources) and their lifecycle states, and the
   **invariants** ("an order always has ≥1 item", "a refund never exceeds
   the charge"). Endpoints fall out of the model; modeling from endpoints
   produces RPC soup.
2. Identify ownership and multiplicity — who may see/mutate what. This
   becomes the authz story; retrofitting it is a rewrite.
3. Decide the consistency story per resource: read-your-writes? eventually
   consistent lists? Say it in the contract, or clients will assume and
   file bugs.

## Phase 2 — Decide the boring things explicitly (once, globally)

These are where APIs rot; decide each and write it down:

- **Errors**: one machine-readable shape (code, message, field errors,
  retryable flag). Which codes for validation vs authz vs not-found vs
  conflict. Never leak internals in messages.
- **Pagination**: cursor-based unless there's a reason; stability
  guarantees under concurrent writes stated.
- **Idempotency**: every non-GET mutation accepts an idempotency key, or
  the doc explains why double-submit is safe.
- **Versioning & evolution**: additive changes only within a version;
  what "additive" means (new optional fields OK; enum values — decide!);
  deprecation policy with dates.
- **Naming and shape conventions**: casing, plural resources, timestamps
  (RFC 3339, UTC), money (integer minor units + currency — never floats),
  ids (opaque strings — clients must not parse them).
- **Limits**: max page size, payload size, rate limits — in the contract,
  not discovered in production.

## Phase 3 — Walk the contract before building it

Write the actual request/response bodies for the 5 most important real
sequences — including the failure legs (create → conflict → retry with
same idempotency key; list → paginate while items are deleted; partial
update racing another update). If writing an example feels awkward, the
design is wrong *here*, at the cheapest possible moment.

With subagent tools, run a mini `judge-panel`: one reviewer as the
first-time integrator (is the happy path obvious?), one as the operator
(can this be rate-limited/monitored/rolled back?), one as the adversary
(mass assignment, IDOR, enumeration via ids or error differences).

## Phase 4 — Deliver

The contract document: model + invariants, the global decisions table,
the walked examples, and open questions. Then (if asked) the spec artifact
(OpenAPI/proto) generated *from* the design — not the other way around.

## Rules

- No endpoint ships without its error responses designed.
- Anything a client could misread as ordering/consistency guarantees must
  be stated explicitly, one way or the other.
- Follow the platform's conventions where they exist; consistency with
  the ecosystem beats local elegance.
