description: Write documentation that answers the reader's next question — pick the doc type (tutorial/how-to/reference/explanation) deliberately, verify every command and snippet by running it, structure for the impatient reader. Use for READMEs, API docs, runbooks, or onboarding guides.

# Write Docs

Input (arguments): what to document and for whom. Output: docs where every
example was executed and every claim checked against the current code.

The failure mode of most docs is not bad writing — it's **untested
examples and wrong audience**. Both are checkable.

## Phase 1 — One doc, one job

Pick the type deliberately (mixing them is why docs sprawl):

- **Tutorial** — a guaranteed-success first experience for a beginner;
  one golden path, zero choices, working result at the end.
- **How-to** — a task recipe for someone mid-work ("rotate the API key");
  starts from a stated precondition, numbered steps, done-check at the end.
- **Reference** — complete and boring: every option, type, default,
  error. Generated from code where possible so it can't drift.
- **Explanation** — why it's built this way; the design's forces and
  trade-offs. No steps.

State the reader in one line ("a developer with the repo cloned but no
credentials") — every later sentence gets judged against them.

## Phase 2 — Extract truth from the code, not from memory

Docs written from memory document the system as it was. Verify against
the current tree: actual flag names and defaults, actual error messages,
actual version requirements. For a runbook, walk the real dashboards and
commands. Anything you can't verify, mark `TODO(verify)` visibly rather
than guessing plausibly — a plausible wrong doc is worse than a gap.

## Phase 3 — Write for the impatient

- Lead with what the thing does and the fastest working example — not
  history or philosophy.
- Structure for scanning: informative headings (they should read as a
  summary by themselves), short paragraphs, code blocks that are
  copy-paste-complete (imports and setup included, no `...`).
- Show, then tell: example first, prose explaining it after.
- State the failure modes honestly: what the common errors look like and
  what they actually mean. The best docs are the ones open when things
  break.
- Placeholders unmistakably fake (`YOUR_API_KEY`, `example.com`) — never
  realistic-looking secrets or hosts.

## Phase 4 — Test the docs like code

1. **Run every command and snippet** in a clean environment (fresh clone,
   fresh venv/container). The doc's steps either produce the promised
   result or the doc is broken. This step is not optional and finds real
   product bugs, not just doc bugs.
2. Beginner replay for tutorials: follow your own steps literally,
   without using any knowledge not on the page. Every place you had to
   improvise is a missing step.
3. Add the drift guards where they're cheap: doctest-style executable
   snippets, CI that runs the quickstart, links checked.

## Report

What was written, which examples were executed and where, remaining
`TODO(verify)` items, and any product bugs found while testing the steps.
