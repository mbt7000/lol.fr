name: growth-map
description: Connect the person to their work and achievements — a living map from goals to active work to evidence-backed accomplishments, with drift detection and per-review deltas. Use when the user asks "what am I actually achieving", wants tasks connected to goals, or in the growth step of the review chain. The hub tracks task state; this map tracks goal meaning.

# Growth Map

Output: `work/growth.md` — one page answering with evidence: *where am
I going, what am I doing about it, what have I achieved?* This is the
layer above `work-hub`: **the hub tracks tasks; the map tracks whether
the tasks amount to anything.**

## The structure

```
work/growth.md
  ## Goals        3–5 max, each with a WHY and a measurable "done looks like"
  ## Active       which hub projects serve which goal
  ## Achievements dated, evidence-linked, newest first
  ## Drift        a VIEW of effort serving no goal (verdicts live elsewhere — below)
  ## Review log   one dated line per review — this is the run history
```

**Bootstrap (first run):** if there is no hub, build a minimal one
first (`work-hub`); if there is no vault, skip vault steps and say so.
Goals come from a short interview plus what `git log` shows the person
actually spending themselves on — the gap between the two is the first
insight.

## The full mapping pass

1. **Goals first.** Elicit or refresh 3–5 goals, each with a *why* one
   level deeper ("learn Rust" → "move to systems work"). More than
   five goals is zero goals.
2. **Map the work.** Walk the hub's projects and recent `git log`:
   every active thread maps to a goal or lands in Drift. No creative
   storytelling that maps everything to "growth".
3. **Harvest achievements.** Completed work enters only with
   **evidence**: the shipped PR, the published page, the measured
   improvement. "Worked on X" is not an achievement. Candidates come
   from closed hub items and recent vault notes (if a vault exists).
4. **Decide the drift.** Each drift item gets the user's verdict —
   promote / timebox / drop. Verdicts are decisions: **append them to
   `work/decisions.md`** (work-hub's append-only log), and park
   timeboxed/dropped threads via `work/someday.md`. The map's Drift
   section only *summarizes and links* — one home per fact.

## Cadence tiers (which steps run when)

- **Weekly** (the review-chain step): steps 3–4 plus the delta below.
  ~10 minutes.
- **Monthly**: the full pass, steps 1–4 (goal refresh included).
- **Quarterly**: monthly pass + prune — retire achieved/dead goals,
  archive old achievements to the vault.

## The delta (what makes it feel alive)

End every review by appending one line to **Review log**
(`2026-07-11: +2 achievements; goal G2 advanced; G3 dry 3rd review`)
and committing (`growth: review YYYY-MM-DD`). The delta is computed
against the previous Review-log entry and the file's git history —
that log **is** the run memory; without it there are no streaks. A
goal with zero mapped activity across 3+ entries gets named as stalled.

## Feeding the rest of the system

- Stalled goal → `plan-builder` for a concrete next slice.
- Harvested achievement → one vault line (`knowledge-loop`) with what
  was learned; repeated kinds of achievement → candidates for
  `learning-tracker`'s ledger.
- Goals and whys inform `intent-reader`'s standing-interest layer;
  person-scoped needs surfaced here route to `companion-profile`.

## Rules

- Evidence or it didn't happen — no achievement without an artifact.
- The user owns the goals; propose edits, never rewrite ambitions
  silently.
- Task state belongs to the hub; decisions to decisions.md; this file
  carries meaning, links, and the review log — duplication is drift of
  its own.
