description: Refactor with a proven safety net — characterization tests first, mechanical steps with a green suite between each, behavior-identical by construction. Use when restructuring working code, breaking up a large function/module, or paying down tech debt.

# Refactor Safely

Input (arguments): the code to restructure and the target shape.
Output: the same externally observable behavior, better structure, and a
commit trail where every commit is green.

Refactoring means **behavior-preserving** change. The moment behavior
changes on purpose, that's a feature/fix — split it out and do it
separately. Mixing the two is how refactors ship bugs.

## Phase 1 — Build the net before touching anything

1. Run the existing suite; record what's green. If the target code has no
   meaningful tests, write **characterization tests** first: capture what
   the code *actually does now* (including its weird cases), not what it
   should do. Golden-master snapshots of outputs over a broad input sweep
   are legitimate here.
2. Capture current behavior at the seams you'll refactor across: inputs
   and outputs of the functions whose bodies will change.
3. If behavior is currently wrong, note the bug, keep the
   characterization pinning the wrong behavior, and file the fix as
   separate follow-up work. (Fixing it mid-refactor destroys your ability
   to detect refactor-introduced breakage.)

## Phase 2 — Plan mechanical steps

Decompose into steps of a known-safe shape, each independently green:

- extract function/module (new name, move code, delegate);
- inline the needless indirection;
- introduce parameter object / replace flag argument;
- move code toward its data;
- rename (last — renames create diff noise that hides real changes).

Order steps so each is small enough that if the suite goes red, the cause
is obvious. A step you can't describe in one sentence is two steps.

## Phase 3 — Execute: red means undo, not debug

Per step: apply → run the affected tests → run the full suite → commit
with the step as the message. If the suite goes red and the cause isn't
obvious within a couple of minutes, **revert the step** and re-split it
smaller. Debugging a refactor step is a smell that the step was too big.

Never batch steps between test runs to save time — the batch is exactly
where the bug hides.

## Phase 4 — Prove equivalence

1. Full suite green, including the characterization tests — which are the
   actual proof of behavior preservation.
2. Diff review pass: scan the final diff for anything that isn't
   structure — changed literals, reordered side effects, dropped error
   handling, swapped evaluation order on expressions with effects.
3. Delete or promote characterization tests: keep the ones that pin real
   contracts, drop pure golden-masters that would block future honest
   changes.

## Parallel variant

For refactors spanning many files with a mechanical rule, switch to
`swarm-migrate` (central spec, isolated workers). Use `parallel-review`
on the final diff. This skill is for the *structural* refactors that need
one mind holding the design.
