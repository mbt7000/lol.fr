name: companion-profile
description: A consent-first personal model of the user — accumulate their person-scoped requirements, preferences, and context as auditable, provenance-tagged entries in a profile file they own, so every session fits them better. Use when the user states a durable personal preference, asks Claude to "remember" or "learn" them, or during profile reviews (the review chain in conductor).

# Companion Profile

Output: the user's profile file — the written, transparent model of what
this person needs. Not a hidden memory: **a file the user owns**, reads,
edits, and deletes at will.

## Ownership boundary (who stores what — this is strict)

- **This profile stores person-scoped facts** — true about the *user*
  across all projects: language, working hours, risk appetite, "prefers
  diffs over rewrites", device/plan constraints.
- **CLAUDE.md stores project-scoped facts** — true about a *repo*:
  commands, conventions, hard rules of this codebase. That file is
  `claude-tuner`'s domain.

When `intent-reader` or `skill-forge` surfaces a durable preference:
person-scoped → here; project-scoped → CLAUDE.md via `claude-tuner`.
One datum, one home, never both.

## Location and honest privacy model

- **Default: `~/.claude/profile.md`** — personal, cross-project, and
  outside any repo, so it is never committed or pushed anywhere.
- Optional: `work/profile.md` inside a repo — but say plainly what that
  means: it is **shared with everyone who can read that repo** and goes
  wherever the repo is pushed. Use it only for team-safe entries, and
  never in a public repo.
- Never quote profile contents into outward-facing artifacts (PRs,
  issues, published pages, other repos).
- On conflict between the profile and what the user says *now*, now
  wins — then update the entry.

## What goes in (three sections)

1. **Requirements** — obeyed: "output in Arabic", "never push without
   asking".
2. **Preferences** — weighed: verbosity, review strictness, commenting
   taste.
3. **Context** — informs: timezone, team size, "on a Sonnet plan —
   prefer token-efficient approaches".

Excluded always: health/beliefs/relationships (unless the user writes
them personally), secrets and tokens (point to where they live), and
moods (per-session — `intent-reader`'s job).

## The entry contract (every line)

```
- [req] Output responses in Arabic; code identifiers in English.
  (source: stated 2026-07-11)
- [pref] Prefers diffs over full-file rewrites.
  (source: observed 3x, confirmed 2026-07-11)
```

Provenance is mandatory: `stated`, or `observed + confirmed`. Patterns
you observed but the user has not yet approved go **only** in the
staging section:

```
## Pending (proposals — not part of the profile)
- [pref?] Seems to prefer squash-merges. (observed 2x — propose at next review)
```

Pending entries are never treated as profile content. Propose them in
batch at a natural moment; approved → promoted with provenance,
declined → deleted.

## Bootstrap (first run)

1. Create the file with the three sections plus Pending.
2. Seed only from what the user states in the conversation — never
   backfill from observation without the consent gate.
3. Wire consumption: with the user's OK, add one line to the project's
   CLAUDE.md — `See ~/.claude/profile.md for personal requirements.` —
   so sessions actually read it (`claude-tuner` also adds this line
   when it runs). Until wired, the profile works only when explicitly
   read; say so rather than implying automatic inheritance.

## Maintenance

During profile reviews (see `conductor`'s review chain): propose the
Pending batch, flag entries unused or contradicted for ~3 months for
confirm-or-drop, and prune. Target: **under 40 lines** — overflow
detail goes to the vault, linked.

## Rules

- Consent before any entry; provenance on every line; the user owns
  the file.
- Requirements are obeyed, preferences are weighed, context informs —
  never with equal force.
- Person-scoped here, project-scoped in CLAUDE.md — no duplicates.
