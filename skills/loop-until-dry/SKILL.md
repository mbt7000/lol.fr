description: Exhaustive discovery loop for unknown-size problems (find all bugs, all usages, all edge cases, all sources) — keep launching fresh finder rounds until K consecutive rounds surface nothing new. Use when the user says "find ALL …" or "make sure nothing is missed".

# Loop Until Dry

Input (arguments): a discovery goal — "find all the places that parse
dates by hand", "find every bug in the auth module", "find all papers
measuring X".

The core insight: for unknown-size discovery, any fixed count ("find 10
bugs") is wrong — it either stops early or pads with junk. The correct
stop condition is **saturation**: K consecutive rounds with zero new
findings (default K = 2).

## State to maintain (inline, across rounds)

- `seen`: every finding ever surfaced, keyed by a stable identity
  (file+line, URL, claim text) — **including ones later rejected**.
  Deduplicate against `seen`, never against the accepted list, or rejected
  findings resurface every round and the loop never converges.
- `accepted`: findings that passed verification.
- `dry`: count of consecutive rounds with no new findings.

## Per round

1. **Vary the finders.** Spawn 2–4 finder agents in one batch, each with a
   *different* strategy than previous rounds used — by directory, by
   grep-pattern family, by call-graph neighborhood, by git-history
   hotspots, by "what would the previous finders have missed". Repeating an
   exhausted strategy manufactures dry rounds; state each round's
   strategies explicitly.
2. **Filter.** Drop everything already in `seen`; add the rest to `seen`.
   If nothing new: `dry += 1`, next round.
3. **Verify.** For each fresh finding, one quick refutation check (is it
   real, is it in scope). Passed → `accepted`. `dry = 0`.
4. **Log progress** in one line: `round N: +X new, Y accepted total,
   dry=Z`.

## Stop conditions (all hard)

- `dry >= K` → saturated, report.
- Round cap (default 8 rounds) → report with "cap reached, possibly
  incomplete" stated plainly.
- Scope collapse: if verification rejects >80% of a round, the goal is
  ambiguous — stop and ask the user to sharpen it rather than burn rounds.

## Report

The `accepted` list grouped meaningfully, plus a coverage statement: which
strategies were run, rounds used, and whether the loop ended by saturation
or by cap. "Ended by cap" and "ended by saturation" are very different
claims — never blur them.

## Fallback (no subagent tools)

Run each round's strategies yourself sequentially; keep the `seen` /
`accepted` / `dry` bookkeeping in a scratch file so long sessions don't
lose it.
