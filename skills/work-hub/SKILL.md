name: work-hub
description: Maintain a single-pane-of-glass work hub in a git repo — every project, task, decision, and skill-development thread visible and current from one place. Use for "organize my work in one repo", standup/status generation, or keeping multi-project agent work coordinated.

# Work Hub

Input (arguments): optional — a specific update ("mark X done", "add
project Y"), or nothing for a full refresh. Output: the hub files updated
so that **one file answers "what's going on?"** — for the user, for
future sessions, and for any agent picking up work.

## The structure (create on first run, maintain thereafter)

```
HUB.md                  the dashboard — always current, always short
work/
  projects/<name>.md    one page per project/thread
  decisions.md          append-only decision log
  someday.md            parked ideas (explicitly NOT commitments)
```

**HUB.md** is the contract. It contains, in order: *Now* (the 1–3 things
actively in progress, each with its next action), *Blocked* (waiting on
what, since when), *Next up* (ready to start, ordered), and a one-line
link per active project page. If HUB.md exceeds ~40 lines, it's hoarding
detail that belongs in project pages — move it.

**Project pages** carry: goal (one sentence), current state, next
actions as checkboxes, and a dated log of what happened (newest first).
The log is what lets a fresh session resume without re-discovery.

**decisions.md**: date, decision, why, alternatives rejected —
append-only. Half of lost work is re-litigating decided things.

## The refresh protocol (any run)

1. **Reconcile with reality, not memory**: diff the hub against the
   actual state — `git log` across the repo(s), open PRs/issues if
   accessible, test/CI status. A hub that drifts from reality is worse
   than no hub, because it's trusted.
2. Every completed item: checked off *and* one log line in its project
   page. Every new thread discovered: a project page or a `someday.md`
   line — nothing lives only in someone's head.
3. Every *Now* item must have a concrete next action ("write the
   migration for X", not "continue X"). No next action = it's actually
   Blocked or Next-up — move it honestly.
4. **WIP limit**: more than 3 items in *Now* is a lie about parallelism —
   demote the extras to Next up.
5. Commit: `hub: refresh YYYY-MM-DD` (or a specific message for a
   specific update).

## Skill development tracking (optional section)

For users developing a skills library or their own craft: a
`work/skills-dev.md` page listing each skill/capability being developed
with its state (idea → drafted → tested-in-anger → published) and what
the next promotion requires. Skills advance on *evidence* ("used it on a
real bug, found two gaps") — logged in the page like any project.

## Status on demand

Asked for standup/status/report: generate it *from* the hub (Now /
finished since last time / blocked-with-asks), never from scratch. If
generating it requires digging outside the hub, that's a hub bug — fix
the hub in the same run.

## Rules

- One hub per repo; multi-repo users keep the hub in one "home" repo
  with links out — two hubs means zero hubs.
- The hub tracks work; knowledge goes to the vault (`knowledge-loop`),
  and a task's useful residue becomes a note there when it closes.
- Never delete history — completed projects move to a `## Done` section
  or `work/archive/`, greppable forever.
