# Spec First

Input (arguments): a feature request, idea, or vague ask ("add sharing",
"make onboarding better"). Output: a one-to-two-page spec that a developer
(or an agent) can build from without guessing — plus the explicit list of
what was deliberately cut.

Ambiguity doesn't disappear when you skip the spec; it moves into the
code, where every unstated decision gets made silently by whoever types.

## Phase 1 — Find the real goal

1. Separate the **problem** from the **proposed solution** in the ask.
   "Add an export button" is a solution; the problem might be "accountant
   needs monthly data in Excel" — which a scheduled email solves better.
   Spec the problem's best solution, note where it diverges from the ask.
2. Name the user(s) and the trigger moment: who is doing what when this
   feature saves them. A feature without a trigger moment is decoration.
3. Write the one-sentence success statement: "X can now Y in under Z."

## Phase 2 — Hunt ambiguities and decide them in writing

Walk the feature and force every fork into a decision (decide yourself
with stated reasoning when you can; queue genuine judgment calls for the
user as a short numbered list — never dribble questions one at a time):

- **Edge population**: what happens for new users / empty state / the
  10,000-item user / the deleted-account case?
- **Permissions**: who can see/do this; what does everyone else see?
- **Failure legs**: offline, partial save, double-click, concurrent edit?
- **Data**: what's stored, retained how long, migrated from where?
- **Boundaries**: mobile? localization? accessibility? existing-feature
  interactions that could conflict?

Every decision goes in the spec as "Decided: X, because Y" — including
the ones that feel obvious. Obvious-to-you is where two implementers
diverge. Unresolved items go in an explicit **Open questions** section —
a spec with named open questions is honest; a spec without any is
usually unexamined.

## Phase 3 — Acceptance criteria as testable statements

Convert the behavior into checkable claims, each falsifiable by a test or
a manual step: "Given a user with no projects, the share button is
hidden." If a criterion can't be phrased as given/when/then, it isn't a
criterion yet — it's a wish. These become the test plan verbatim.

## Phase 4 — Cut scope out loud

1. Stage the feature: v0 (the smallest shippable slice that hits the
   success statement), v1, later. Most requests hide three features;
   shipping the first teaches you whether the other two are real.
2. **Non-goals section**: what this deliberately does not do. Non-goals
   prevent scope creep more effectively than any process, because they
   convert "while we're at it" into a visible spec change.
3. Sanity-check buildability: does v0 touch any system that needs a
   design of its own (new infra, migrations, third-party contracts)?
   Flag those as prerequisite specs, don't bury them in a task list.

## Output format

Problem & success statement → Users & trigger → Decided behaviors (the
Phase 2 list) → Acceptance criteria → Staging (v0/v1/later) → Non-goals →
Open questions. Short enough to read; complete enough to build without
DMing the author.
