description: Track the skills the PERSON is acquiring — an evidence-based ledger with behavioral levels, recall reviews generated from their own vault notes, and one next-skill recommendation tied to goals. Use when the user asks what they're learning, wants a learning review, or in the learning step of the review chain. (Claude's own skills are tracked in skills-dev.md by skill-forge, not here.)

# Learning Tracker

Output: `work/learning.md` — the person's skill ledger, built from
evidence of real work, not course-completion feelings. Mirror image of
`skill-forge`: the forge grows *Claude's* skills (tracked in
`work/skills-dev.md`); this file tracks the *human's* competencies —
two ledgers, two subjects, never mixed.

## The file

```
work/learning.md
  ## Ledger        skill | level | last evidence (dated, linked) | next promotion needs
  ## Recall queue  note | last reviewed | next due | misses
```

Levels are behavioral: **exposed** (can discuss) → **assisted** (done
with heavy help) → **independent** (done alone on a real task,
recently) → **fluent** (fast, teaches it, spots others' mistakes).
**A level changes only on evidence** — a commit, a debugged incident, a
note explaining the concept in their own words. Never on time elapsed
or enthusiasm.

## Detection pass

Sweep the real traces since the last run:

1. `git log` — first-time technologies, patterns used without prior
   examples, problems solved that failed before.
2. The vault — new claim-notes clustering in a topic mean active
   learning; a note that *explains why* outweighs three that quote docs.
3. `growth-map`'s achievements — repeated kinds reveal a skill crossing
   to independent.
4. Struggle signals (optional, only where a source exists): repeated
   fix/revert cycles in `git log`, vault notes recording the same
   confusion twice, or — locally, if readable — recent session
   transcripts showing the same error class. A recurring struggle marks
   a skill stuck at *assisted*: name it, don't flatter it.

**Bootstrap**: no vault or no growth map → run on `git log` + interview
alone and say which sources were absent.

## Recall reviews (learning from the second brain)

Knowledge decays unless re-queried. The **Recall queue** section holds
the state: each tracked note with last-reviewed date, next-due date,
and miss count.

- **Interactive runs only**: pick the 3–5 due notes, turn each into a
  question from its own content ("your note claims X about SQLite WAL —
  why?"), check the answer against the note. Hit → next interval
  expands (≈1w → 1m → 3m); miss → `misses+1`, requeue sooner; two
  misses → the note itself is probably unclear — route it to
  `knowledge-loop`'s distill step.
- **Unattended runs** (when piggybacking on a scheduled loop): do the
  detection pass and update the queue's due-dates only; emit the due
  questions in the run report for the next interactive session — never
  self-answer a recall review.

## Next-skill recommendation

When asked "what should I learn next": candidates come from
`growth-map`'s goals and the ledger's gaps (an *assisted* skill
blocking *independent* work elsewhere). Recommend **one** skill with
the concrete first project that would generate its evidence — hand
that project to `plan-builder`. Never a list; lists are how learning
plans die.

## Rules

- Evidence links or no entry — the ledger's value is that it's true.
- 5–12 active skills; an unbounded ledger is a diary.
- Honest levels are the kindness: inflating *assisted* to *independent*
  sets the person up to fail alone.
- Commit reviews as `learning: review YYYY-MM-DD`.
