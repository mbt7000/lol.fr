name: graphify
description: Turn any documentation corpus (an llms.txt index, a docs site, or a folder of markdown) into an Obsidian vault — wikilinked notes, Maps of Content, tagged frontmatter — a queryable "second brain". Use when the user wants docs as a vault, a knowledge graph, or an offline second brain of any documentation.

# Graphify

Input (arguments): a documentation source — an `llms.txt` URL (many doc
sites expose one, e.g. `https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt`), a docs
site URL, or a local folder of `.md` files — plus an output location.
Output: an Obsidian-compatible vault the user can open immediately.

## Fast path — the bundled tool

This repo ships a stdlib-only Python implementation. Prefer it:

```bash
python3 tools/graphify.py list   <source>                      # preview pages
python3 tools/graphify.py obsidian <source> --vault <dir>      # build vault
python3 tools/graphify.py obsidian <source> --vault <dir> --limit 40 --include 'sdk|hooks'
```

It parses the index, downloads each page, rewrites cross-references
between pages as `[[wikilinks]]` (this is what makes Obsidian's graph
view light up), adds YAML frontmatter (`title`, `source`, `section`,
`tags`, `fetched`), and generates one `MOC — <Section>` note per section
plus a `Home.md`. Run it, verify (below), and report.

## Manual path — when the tool doesn't fit the source

For sources with no llms.txt (a wiki, HTML-only docs, a PDF set), build
the vault by hand with the same contract:

1. **Inventory** the corpus: list every page with title, URL, and a
   one-line description. No note gets written before the inventory is
   complete — wikilinks need the full namespace to resolve against.
2. **One note per page**, filename = the human title (sanitized).
   Frontmatter carries `source:` (always — a note that can't be traced to
   its source is a liability) and 2–3 tags from a *small controlled
   vocabulary* you define first. Tag sprawl kills vaults.
3. **Wikilink pass** (the heart of it): every reference from note A to a
   concept that has its own note B becomes `[[B]]` or `[[B|anchor text]]`.
   Only link to notes that exist — red links in a generated vault are
   noise.
4. **MOCs, not folders-as-navigation**: one Map of Content note per
   section listing its notes with descriptions, and a `Home.md` linking
   the MOCs. In Obsidian, links are the structure; folders are just
   storage.

## Verify (both paths)

- Note count matches the inventory; spot-open 3 notes — frontmatter
  valid, body intact, source URL correct.
- `grep -c '\[\[' vault -r` > 0 and sampled wikilinks resolve to real
  note filenames.
- `Home.md` reaches every MOC; every MOC reaches every note in its
  section (the graph must be connected — orphan notes defeat the point).

## Respect the source

Committing a generated vault into a public repo redistributes the
content. Default to committing a small attributed sample plus the
one-command recipe to rebuild the full vault; keep full vaults local
unless the license clearly permits redistribution.

## Making it a second brain (not just a mirror)

Tell the user the last mile: the vault becomes a second brain when their
*own* notes link into it — decisions, gotchas, project notes referencing
`[[Hooks]]` or `[[Settings]]`. Pair with the `knowledge-loop` skill for
the maintenance cadence, and re-run graphify to refresh doc notes (their
own notes are never touched).
