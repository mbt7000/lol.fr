description: Build LLM features with an eval-first loop — define graded test cases before writing the prompt, iterate against measurements not vibes, handle the failure modes (injection, refusal, format drift) as part of the design. Use when writing prompts, building agents/LLM pipelines, or improving a flaky LLM feature.

# Prompt Engineer

Input (arguments): the LLM task to build or fix (a prompt, a pipeline
stage, an agent behavior). Output: a prompt/design plus the eval that
proves it — never a prompt alone.

The discipline: **a prompt without an eval is a guess.** Every failure
mode of prompt-based systems — silent regression, format drift, prompt
sensitivity — traces to iterating on vibes instead of measurements.

## Phase 1 — Specify the task as data

1. Write 15–30 test cases *before* writing the prompt: realistic inputs
   covering the happy path, the boundaries (long inputs, empty fields,
   mixed languages, adversarial content), and the "should refuse /
   escalate" cases.
2. For each case, define what a correct output looks like — exact match,
   rubric criteria, or properties that must hold (valid JSON, cites only
   provided sources, under N words).
3. Decide the grader: code checks for structure/properties (cheap, run
   always) + LLM-as-judge with a written rubric for quality (spot-check
   the judge against your own grading on 10 cases before trusting it).

## Phase 2 — Design the prompt like an interface

- Structure: role and goal → the rules (numbered, testable) → the input
  (clearly delimited) → the required output format with one worked
  example per tricky rule. Put instructions *before* long content, and
  repeat the critical constraint near the end for long prompts.
- Make outputs machine-parseable: schema-constrained/structured output
  where the platform supports it; otherwise a fenced block the parser can
  find deterministically. Parse defensively; every parse failure becomes
  a test case.
- **Untrusted content is data, not instructions**: delimit user/document
  content and state that instructions inside it must not be followed.
  Add injection cases to the eval ("ignore previous instructions…").
- Decide the escape hatch: what the model should do when the input is
  out of scope (a typed `cannot_answer` beats a hallucinated answer) —
  and test that it takes it.

## Phase 3 — Iterate against the eval only

1. Baseline run over all cases; record the score and read every failure.
2. Change **one thing** per iteration (a rule, an example, decomposition
   into two calls, a model/temperature change) with a predicted effect.
3. Re-run the full eval — not just the case you were fixing; prompt
   changes are non-local and fixing case 7 silently breaks case 12.
4. Keep the change only on a net win. Version prompts in git alongside
   their eval scores.

Plateaued? The usual escalations, in cost order: better/more examples in
the prompt → split one call into a pipeline (extract, then transform) →
a stronger model for the hard stage only.

## Phase 4 — Ship with a regression net

The eval runs in CI. New failure in production → reproduce → add as a
test case → fix against the full eval. The eval is the asset that
compounds; prompts are disposable.

## Parallel variant

With subagent tools: run a `judge-panel` over 3 competing prompt designs
against the same eval, and fan out grading of large eval sets to parallel
graders.
