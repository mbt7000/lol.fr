# Data Analysis

Input (arguments): a dataset (file/table/query) and a question.
Output: an answer with uncertainty attached, and an honest account of what
the data cannot say.

The two failure modes this protocol prevents: **garbage in** (analyzing
data you never audited) and **p-hacking by wandering** (slicing until
something looks interesting, then narrating it as a finding).

## Phase 1 — Audit the data before any statistics

Never compute on data you haven't profiled:

1. Shape and grain: rows, columns, and **what one row means** — most wrong
   analyses die here (mixed grains, duplicates silently double-counting).
2. Per-column profile: type, null rate, cardinality, min/max, top values.
   Flag: impossible values (negative ages, future timestamps), sentinel
   values pretending to be data (0, -1, 1970-01-01, "N/A" as a string),
   unit mixes (ms vs s, cents vs dollars).
3. Time coverage and gaps; timezone of every timestamp (assume nothing).
4. Selection story: **how did this data come to exist?** What got logged
   vs dropped, who is missing (survivorship, opt-outs, bots included?).
   Write the known biases down — they bound every conclusion downstream.
5. Fix or quarantine issues *explicitly*: document every row dropped and
   why, with counts. Silent cleaning is silent lying.

## Phase 2 — State hypotheses before slicing

Write the specific claims to test *before* exploring: metric, direction,
population, timeframe. Exploration is allowed after — but findings from
wandering are labeled **hypothesis-generating**, and only confirmed if
they hold on data/slices not used to find them.

## Phase 3 — Analyze with uncertainty attached

- Every headline number carries a denominator and a dispersion: medians
  and percentiles for skewed data (latency, revenue, counts) — means hide
  the tail.
- Comparisons carry effect size **and** noise context (confidence
  interval or at minimum the base rates and n's). "Up 12%" on n=40 is
  noise wearing a suit.
- Segment the headline result across the 2–3 most important dimensions —
  aggregates routinely reverse within segments (Simpson's paradox); an
  unsegmented conclusion is unfinished.
- A/B specifics: check assignment balance and sample-ratio mismatch
  before reading the metric; decide the stopping rule before peeking.
- Correlation → causation requires an identification story (experiment,
  natural experiment, controls); otherwise say "associated", visibly.

## Phase 4 — Adversarial pass, then write up

Before reporting, attack your own result: would it survive a different
reasonable metric definition? Removing the top 1% of rows? Excluding the
weird week found in Phase 1? A result that dies under any single
reasonable choice is reported as fragile, with the choice named.

Writeup order: the answer with its uncertainty in the first paragraph →
the evidence (charts labeled with n and axes at honest zero, or noting
the break) → data quality caveats and dropped rows → what the data
cannot answer, and what data would.

## Parallel variant

With subagent tools: fan out the Phase 3 segments to parallel analysts,
and run Phase 4 as `adversarial-verify` skeptics on the headline claim.
