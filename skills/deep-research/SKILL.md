# Deep Research

Answer the research question passed as arguments with a **multi-angle
parallel sweep → deep-read → adversarial fact-check → cited synthesis**
pipeline.

## Phase 0 — Scope (inline)

If the question is underspecified (missing timeframe, region, budget,
definition of "best"), state the assumptions you are adopting in one short
block and proceed — do not stall.

Derive 4–6 **search angles** that are genuinely different ways into the
topic, e.g.:

- direct keyword search
- the opposing/skeptical framing ("criticism of X", "X replication failure")
- primary sources (papers, standards, official docs, filings)
- practitioner experience (forums, issue trackers, postmortems)
- recent developments (last 12 months only)
- quantitative data (benchmarks, datasets, statistics)

## Phase 1 — Sweep (parallel, blind)

Spawn one research agent per angle in a single batch. Each agent:

- searches only its angle and must not speculate beyond sources found;
- returns a raw list of `{claim, source URL, date, quote or figure}` items;
- flags each item `primary` or `secondary`.

Agents are blind to each other — that is what surfaces disagreement.

## Phase 2 — Collide and select (inline)

Merge all items. Explicitly look for **collisions**: claims from different
angles that contradict each other. Collisions are the most valuable output
of the sweep — never average them away. Select the 5–15 claims that will
carry the final answer.

## Phase 3 — Adversarial fact-check (parallel)

For each load-bearing claim, spawn a verifier prompted to **refute** it:

- open the primary source; check the claim against what the source
  actually says (numbers, dates, scope qualifiers);
- check whether the source is outdated, retracted, or misquoted;
- verdict: `confirmed` / `refuted` / `unverifiable`, with one line of
  evidence.

Drop refuted claims. Keep `unverifiable` ones only if clearly labeled as
such in the report.

## Phase 4 — Synthesize (inline)

Write the report yourself:

1. **Answer first** — the direct answer in the first paragraph.
2. Supporting sections organized by sub-question, not by source.
3. Every non-obvious claim cited inline with its URL.
4. A **disagreements** section for surviving collisions: who says what, and
   which side the evidence favors.
5. A **limits** section: angles that came up dry, claims that were
   unverifiable, cutoff dates.

## Stop conditions

- One sweep round by default. Run a second, narrower sweep only if the
  fact-check killed the core answer.
- Hard cap: two rounds, then report with limits stated.

## Fallback (no subagent tools)

Run the angles as sequential searches yourself, keeping notes per angle
before merging. Never skip Phase 3 — check every load-bearing claim against
its primary source before writing the report.
