# Incident Response

Input (arguments): the symptom — an alert, error spike, outage report.
Output: service restored, then root cause, then a postmortem with action
items. **In that order** — diagnosis is a luxury the user's downtime pays
for.

## Phase 0 — Triage (first 5 minutes)

1. Confirm blast radius with data, not the report: which endpoints/regions/
   tenants, what error rate, since exactly when. Dashboards and logs, not
   vibes.
2. Start the **timeline file** now; append every observation and action
   with a timestamp as you go. Memory does not survive an incident, and
   the postmortem is only as good as this file.
3. Classify severity honestly: data loss/corruption in progress beats
   downtime; downtime beats degradation. Data corruption changes the
   playbook — consider stopping writes even at the cost of availability.

## Phase 1 — Stabilize (mitigate, don't fix)

The first question is never "what's the bug?" — it's **"what changed?"**:
deploys, config pushes, feature flags, dependency/provider incidents,
traffic shape, certificate and token expiries, disk/quota exhaustion,
cron jobs. Most incidents are a change; the fastest mitigation is undoing
it.

- Prefer reversible mitigations in this order: roll back the last deploy →
  disable the feature flag → shed load / rate-limit → scale up → failover.
- **One change at a time, verified before the next.** Two simultaneous
  changes that "fix" it leave you not knowing which one did — you will pay
  for that at the next occurrence.
- Before any state-changing command, write down what you expect it to do;
  if the evidence doesn't clearly support that action, it's a guess —
  label it as one and prefer a safer probe first.

## Phase 2 — Diagnose (once bleeding stops)

Now switch to `debug-protocol` discipline: reproduce (in staging if
possible), hypothesize ranked by "what changed", bisect one variable at a
time. Correlation across signals (deploy marker lining up with error-rate
inflection) is your fastest evidence. Keep appending to the timeline.

## Phase 3 — Fix and verify

1. The real fix ships through the normal pipeline (tests, review) — the
   incident is not a license to cowboy a second change into prod.
2. Verify with the same dashboards that showed the symptom, over a long
   enough window to trust it (an error rate needs time to prove it's
   flat).
3. Remove the mitigations deliberately, watching the same signals — a
   forgotten "temporary" flag is next quarter's mystery.

## Phase 4 — Postmortem (blameless, concrete)

From the timeline file: impact (duration, users, data), root cause as a
causal chain, what went well/badly in the response, and action items each
with an owner and a due date. Actions must be structural ("add alert on
X", "make deploys auto-rollback on Y") — "be more careful" is not an
action item.

## Rules

- Never debug interesting mysteries while users are down — mitigate first.
- Never delete or overwrite state (logs, DB rows, pods) that is your only
  forensic evidence, without copying it first.
- If two people/agents respond, one drives, one scribes — parallel
  uncoordinated prod changes are how incidents get worse.
