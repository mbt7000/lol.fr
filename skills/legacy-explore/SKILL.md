description: Build an accurate mental map of an unfamiliar or legacy codebase before changing it — entry points, data flow, load-bearing invariants, and the danger list. Use when onboarding onto a codebase, or before modifying code nobody understands anymore.

# Legacy Explore

Input (arguments): a repo/module and optionally the change you intend to
make. Output: a **map document** — enough understanding to change the code
without triggering the traps.

Reading a legacy codebase linearly is how you drown. Explore by
**questions**, not by files.

## Phase 1 — Outside-in survey (30 minutes max)

1. How is it run? Entry points, main binaries/services, deploy artifacts
   (`Dockerfile`, `Procfile`, CI config tell the truth even when docs lie).
2. What are the dependencies and the storage? The schema/migrations
   directory is often the best domain documentation that exists.
3. Volume and heat: largest directories; then `git log --stat` hotspots —
   the files that change most are where the business lives (and where the
   bodies are buried).
4. Test signal: does a suite exist, does it pass *right now*, how long
   does it take. This determines how brave any future change can be.

## Phase 2 — Trace one real request end-to-end

Pick the most representative operation (one HTTP request, one job, one CLI
command) and trace it fully: entry → validation → business logic → storage
→ response. Write the chain down with file:line references. One deep
vertical slice teaches more than ten shallow overviews, and it forces
discovery of the middleware, DI wiring, and conventions everything else
uses.

With subagent tools: fan out parallel tracers over 3–4 different operation
types (read path, write path, background job, auth flow), blind, then
merge — disagreement between their maps marks exactly where the codebase
is inconsistent.

## Phase 3 — Hunt the invariants and the traps

The dangerous knowledge is never in the README:

- **Invariants**: what must stay true (orderings, uniqueness, "this table
  is append-only", "this enum is persisted — never renumber"). Found in
  assertions, DB constraints, and long comments near scary code.
- **Traps**: global mutable state, hidden temporal coupling ("must call
  init() first"), things named misleadingly, dead code that looks alive,
  live code that looks dead (reflection, string-built calls, cron-invoked
  scripts, config-driven dispatch).
- `git blame` the weirdest code before judging it — the commit message or
  its linked ticket often reveals the invariant it protects. **Chesterton's
  fence rule: no fence removed until you can state why it was built.**

## Phase 4 — The map document

Write it for the next person (or the next session):

1. One-paragraph purpose; architecture in ~10 lines (components + arrows).
2. The traced slice(s) with file:line references.
3. Invariants list; danger list ("do not touch X without Y").
4. Where your intended change should land, and which existing pattern it
   should copy — matching local convention beats imported best practice.
5. Open questions you could not resolve, stated as questions.

## Rule

Do not propose refactors during exploration. Judgment formed before the
invariants are known is what legacy code punishes; note the smells and
finish the map first.
