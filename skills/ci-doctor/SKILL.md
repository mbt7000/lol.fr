description: Diagnose and fix failing CI — read the actual failing step's logs, classify (real failure / flake / infra / drift), reproduce locally before pushing, never retry-loop blindly. Use when CI is red, a pipeline is flaky, or a PR needs to get green.

# CI Doctor

Input (arguments): a failing pipeline/PR, or "CI is flaky". Output: green
CI via the *correct* fix — or a precise diagnosis of what's broken beyond
the repo.

The anti-pattern this skill exists to kill: pushing speculative fixes and
re-running until green. Every blind retry that passes teaches the team the
suite is noise.

## Phase 1 — Read the actual failure

1. Open the logs of the **first failing step** — later failures are
   usually cascade. Find the first real error line, not the last (the
   tail is often cleanup noise after the true failure scrolled past).
2. Record: failing job, step, error signature, runner/OS, and the commit.
3. Check history before diagnosing: did this exact job fail the same way
   on other recent commits/branches? Same-signature failures across
   unrelated commits → not your diff.

## Phase 2 — Classify (the diagnosis IS the classification)

- **Real failure**: your diff broke it. Signature correlates with the
  change. → Fix the code via `debug-protocol`.
- **Flake**: intermittent, passes on retry, timing/ordering words in the
  error (timeout, race, port in use, `ECONNRESET`). → Fixing means fixing
  the *test* (or its isolation), not retrying. One legitimate retry to
  confirm intermittency is diagnosis; retry #2 without a theory is denial.
- **Infra**: runner died, network to registry failed, cache corrupt,
  quota/disk. Signature mentions the platform, not your code. → Retry is
  actually correct here; if recurring, pin/report it.
- **Drift**: nobody changed this code, but a dependency/base-image/
  toolchain moved underneath (unpinned versions, `latest` tags, a
  deprecation landing). Check what resolved differently between the last
  green and first red run. → Pin it, then upgrade deliberately.

## Phase 3 — Reproduce locally before pushing anything

Run the failing step's actual command (from the workflow file, not from
memory) locally or in the CI image (`act`, or `docker run` the same
image). Environment diffs that break this are themselves the bug: version
skew between local and CI, missing env vars, case-sensitive paths, CPU
count assumptions, UTC vs local time.

Can't reproduce locally? Add one diagnostic commit (dump versions, env,
the flaky test's timing) rather than five guess commits.

## Phase 4 — Fix by class, then harden

- Real → fix, with a test if the gap allowed it through.
- Flake → fix the root (await the condition instead of sleeping, isolate
  the port/tmpdir/DB state, seed the randomness). Quarantine with a
  tracking issue only if the fix is genuinely out of scope today.
- Drift → pin the version that moved; schedule the real upgrade.
- Then harden while you're here: cache keys correct? timeouts sane? does
  the failing step upload the artifacts you needed for this diagnosis?

Verify: the previously failing job green **twice** if flakiness was
involved, and the fix explained in the commit message (which class, what
root cause) so the next person inherits the diagnosis, not just the fix.

## Watching a PR

Asked to babysit a PR to green: on each failure event, re-run this
protocol from Phase 1 — never downgrade to blind re-kicks. Report the
class of each failure fixed; escalate to the user when a failure is real
but out of the PR's scope.
