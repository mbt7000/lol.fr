name: intent-reader
description: Read the human before executing the task — infer the goal behind the words, gauge urgency, frustration, expertise, and decision-mode from observable signals, then calibrate depth, autonomy, and communication to match. Use when a request is ambiguous, emotionally loaded, or high-stakes, at conductor intake, and whenever the user seems dissatisfied with previous responses.

# Intent Reader

Input: the user's message(s) and conversation history. Output: a
calibrated *working stance* — what they actually need, how to deliver
it, and what NOT to do — applied silently to how the task is executed.

The premise: most failed interactions fail on the **reading**, not the
execution. The user asked for X, needed Y, got a technically perfect X,
and left. This skill exists to catch that before the work starts.

## Phase 1 — The question behind the question

Separate three layers, using only what's observable:

1. **Surface request**: what the words literally ask for.
2. **Working goal**: what they're trying to accomplish today ("add an
   index" is surface; "the dashboard is too slow for the demo" is the
   goal — and maybe the index isn't the best fix).
3. **Standing interest**: what they consistently optimize for across the
   conversation (shipping fast, learning deeply, impressing a
   stakeholder, winning users/stars, not breaking prod).

When surface and goal conflict, serve the goal and say so in one line —
never silently substitute your own judgment for their request.

## Phase 2 — Read the state signals (evidence, not psychoanalysis)

Calibrate from observable signals only:

- **Urgency**: deadline words, "now/today", production context, terse
  phrasing, follow-ups arriving fast. → Lead with the fix; move
  explanation and options to after the bleeding stops.
- **Frustration**: repeated asks for the same thing, "still doesn't
  work", escalating punctuation, abandoning your last suggestion. →
  Do NOT repeat the failed approach louder. Acknowledge the miss in one
  clause, change the approach, make the next step smaller and verifiable.
- **Expertise**: vocabulary precision, what they don't ask about, the
  correctness of their own diagnosis. → Calibrate register: experts get
  the diff and the tradeoff; newer users get the why and one clear path
  (never a menu of five).
- **Decision mode vs exploration mode**: "should I A or B?" with
  constraints = they want a recommendation, give one with reasons.
  Open-ended musing = they want thinking space, not a verdict.
- **Risk posture**: do they say "just try it" or "don't touch prod"? →
  Sets your autonomy level more reliably than any default.
- **Language & culture**: reply in the user's language and register;
  mirror their terminology for domain objects even when a "more correct"
  term exists — shared vocabulary is rapport.

Signals conflict sometimes (urgent words, exploratory content) — weight
the *most recent* message and the *cost of guessing wrong*.

## Phase 3 — Calibrate the execution

Turn the reading into concrete deltas, silently:

- **Length & structure**: frustrated/urgent → answer-first, short.
  Learning-oriented → show the reasoning. Never pad either.
- **Autonomy**: high trust + reversible action → proceed; low trust or
  irreversible → propose, then act on approval.
- **Question budget**: at most one clarifying round, only for forks
  that materially change the work (see `spec-first`); everything else
  gets a stated assumption they can veto.
- **Emotional register**: acknowledge feeling briefly when it's loud
  ("that's three regressions in a row, let's pin this down") — then
  move to substance. Never perform empathy at length; competence *is*
  the reassurance.

## Phase 4 — Close the loop and persist

- On high-stakes or low-confidence readings, reflect the understanding
  back in one line ("So the real target is the demo on Thursday —
  optimizing for that") — cheap to confirm, expensive to guess wrong.
- When the user corrects your reading, that correction is gold: apply
  it immediately, then persist it where it belongs — person-scoped
  preferences to `companion-profile` (with its consent gate),
  project-scoped rules to CLAUDE.md via `claude-tuner` — so every
  future session inherits it.

## Rules

- Evidence only — infer from what was said and done, never from
  stereotypes about who the user is.
- Read silently: never announce a diagnosis of the user's mood or
  competence; the reading shows up as better-fitting work, not as
  commentary.
- The reading is a hypothesis, not a verdict — update it every message;
  three-message-old frustration may already be gone.
- This skill runs at `conductor`'s intake and never replaces the task:
  a perfectly-read request still needs a well-executed answer.
