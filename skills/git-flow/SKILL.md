# Git Flow

Input (arguments): optional — "commit this", "prepare the PR", "split
this mess". Default: take the current working tree state and turn it
into clean, reviewable history.

History is a product with two users: the **reviewer** this week and the
**archaeologist** (often you, via `git blame` at 2am) in two years. Every
rule below serves one of them.

## Committing

1. **Read the diff before writing anything** — `git diff` + staged +
   untracked. Never describe from memory of what you meant to do; the
   diff is what you actually did, and the gap between the two is where
   bad messages come from.
2. **One intent per commit.** If the diff contains a fix *and* a rename
   *and* a drive-by cleanup, that's three commits — split with selective
   staging (`git add -p` / per-file). The practical test: could a
   reviewer accept one and revert another? Then they're separate.
   Never mix refactor commits with behavior-change commits
   (see `refactor-safely`).
3. **Message = why over what.** Subject ≤ ~70 chars, imperative, names
   the intent ("fix pagination cursor skipping deleted rows"), following
   the repo's existing convention (check `git log` — conventional
   commits, prefixes, ticket refs — local convention wins). Body: the
   *why*, the constraint that shaped the approach, and what was
   deliberately not done. The archaeologist can see the what; only the
   message can carry the why.
4. Pre-commit check: no secrets/keys, no debug prints, no unrelated
   lockfile churn, tests relevant to the change pass. A commit that
   breaks the build poisons `git bisect` for everyone forever.

## Branching

- Name by purpose: `fix/cursor-pagination`, `feat/export-csv` — a
  branch list should read as a work list.
- One branch = one deliverable. Discovered a second problem mid-branch?
  New branch off the default, not a stowaway commit.
- Keep in sync with the default branch by the repo's convention (rebase
  vs merge — check what `git log` shows others doing); never rewrite
  history that's already shared without coordination.

## Preparing the PR

1. Re-read the full branch diff start to finish — this is where the
  stray debug line and the accidental file get caught.
2. Self-review structure: does the commit sequence tell a story a
   reviewer can follow commit-by-commit? If the history is 14 "wip"
   commits, squash/reword into logical steps first.
3. Description contract: what & why (2–4 sentences) → how to verify
   (the commands/steps a reviewer runs) → risks/rollback → what's out
   of scope. Use the repo's PR template when one exists. Link the
   issue; screenshots for anything visual.
4. Right-size: a 1,500-line PR gets rubber-stamped, not reviewed. If it
   grew past ~400 lines of substantive diff, offer to split (stacked
   branches or extract the mechanical parts — reviewers approve a
   rename-only PR in minutes).

## Cleaning a messy tree (the rescue path)

Uncommitted chaos spanning multiple intents: stash nothing, delete
nothing. Inventory the diff hunk-by-hunk → group by intent → commit
group-by-group with selective staging, tests between groups. Anything
experimental that shouldn't survive → a `wip/` branch, not the trash —
disk is cheap, re-discovery isn't.

## Rules

- Never commit on someone else's behalf to hide who did what; never
  amend/rebase published history without explicit agreement.
- Push and PR creation happen when asked — committing locally is the
  default deliverable (see `autopilot`'s safety envelope).
